###DOCUMENTATION
#################################
This is a todo app that uses an api backend provided by a repository from coding bootcamps europe as todo-api. In order to use the provided todo-api, you need to first set it up on your local machine. If you want to use a todo app without a backend server that only works on your local machine, check out my todo repository here: https://github.com/jennywhitmore/web-devs/tree/main/todo

To set the api up on you local machine, which is needed for this repository, use your terminal or bash and follow these steps:

1. clone the todo-api repository provided via github to a new folder on your local machine. Type into your terminal window:
   git clone https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu/todo-api
   2.navigate to the folder of the project
2. Install the dependencies of the todo Api. Type into your terminal window: npm -i
3. Start the api. Type into your terminal window: npm run start
4. Copy the provided link from your terminal window to your browser (something like http://localhost:4730)

You can then use my todo-app-with-api repo index.html, styles.css and script.js, copy them to your local machine in a new folder and open the index.html to your browser to view and use the app.

If you are a beginner and need further advice on how to deal with the todo app, feel free to ask me via github.
